                    <h3> Evolving Website</h3>
                    <p>PCBuilder is a website that will evolve and change over time.  The tech world is an ever-changing space and so
                        the opinions we express today on which components to buy may not be the same in 6 months or in a year.  Be sure to check
                        back before you make your final build for the latest information.

                    <h3>Don't Rush</h3>
                    <p>Many people wait until the last minute to say, "Now I am ready to build a pc" without taking the
                        steps needed to learn pc building. You will be able to put together a much better build if you do your
                        own research ahead of time.  It is also more cost effective if you can look for deals ahead of time.

                    <h3> You will learn as you build</h3>
                    <p>Building a pc is a learning experience.  When you build your first pc, you won't know everything.  It is ok
                        to make a few mistakes along the way.

                    <p>Don't get too stressed out about it.  You are building a cool piece of technology for yourself and more
                        than likely you will be extremely satisfied with the final product.  Although, you might be worried about it,
                        you will be fine. PC Building is getting easier and easier and there are more resources available than ever before.
