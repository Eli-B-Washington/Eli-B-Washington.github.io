                <h2>Introduction </h2>
                <p>Since there are so many different types of pc's (gaming, office, home, professional, etc.)
                    I will focus the following list on building a gaming pc. I have organized the list into what I
                    feel are the most to least important components of building a gaming pc. That being said, every part
                    is important.

                <div id="graphics">
                    <h2>Graphics Card</h2>
                    <p>The most important part of a gaming pc is the graphics card. If focused on gaming, spend the most
                        money on this component. At this point in time, Nvidia
                        has released their new RTX 3000 series GPU's and AMD has released their new 6000's series GPU's.
                        If you are looking,
                        for a card in the 400-700 dollar range, I would not recommend any other graphics cards. Cards in
                        the more budget friendly area of
                        $150 to $400 have been on the market for a few years and I expect them to be phased out soon. At
                        his point my recommendation is to wait until new cards are released.
                        If you cannot wait, google "GPU Heirarchy" and find a graphics card that fits your price to
                        performance.
                    </p>

            <div class="picking_3">
                <div id="cpu">
                    <h2>The CPU</h2>
                    <p>
                        The most important part of a cpu when building a gaming pc is making sure that it does
                        not "bottleneck" or make less effective your graphics card. With that being said, you will see
                        performance gains
                        by having a better cpu and a better cpu will be better for all other tasks that your computer
                        will perform.
                        The amount of cores and threads a cpu has, the clock speed, and the amount of processing for
                        those clock speeds is important.
                        For the general gamer, I would recommend a cpu with at least 6 cores. The ryzen 3600 and the
                        ryzen 5600x are good options
                        from AMD on the base level. The ryzen 3700x or ryzen 5700x and up are better high end options. A
                        search for "CPU Hierarchy" and comparing
                        prices to what you are able to pay again is a good option for looking at cpu's.

                <div id="ssd">
                    <h2>The SSD</h2>
                    <p>I put the SSD high on this list because it is important for having a responsive pc
                        in this day and age and games are now starting to make use of them to a great extent.
                        An M.2 NVMe SSD with DRAM is going to produce the best results as your main hard drive. A good
                        budget
                        option is the crucial P1 ssd. A good higher end SSD is the Samsung 970 EVO. Looking at the read
                        and
                        write speed of the SSD can be a good indicator of how it will perform. Again, googling "SSD
                        Heirarchy" can net good results.

                <div id="ram">
                    <h2>RAM</h2>
                    <p>When choosing RAM, it is important to look at the size, speed, and timings.
                        For PC's with a Ryzen CPU, the higher MHz the RAM the better. As a general recommendation, I
                        would recommend at leasts 16gb (2 sticks X 8gb) of 3200Mhz with timings
                        of 16-18-18-36. RAM in this price range should cost about $65 which is about $20 more than an 8
                        gb kit. Higher amounts of RAM like 32gb are important for video editing.

                <div id="motherboard">
                    <h2>The Motherboard</h2>
                    <p>The Motherboard will need to be compatible with the CPU that you have chosen. Generally, if you
                        go
                        a website like <a class="inline_link" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">pcpartpicker.com</a>, and use their system
                        builder
                        to select a CPU, it will not let you choose a motherboard that is incompatible. Generally, you
                        should choose a motherboard
                        that supports the RAM speed that you choose as well as gives you the ability to overclock if
                        wanted. I tend to lean toward
                        highly rated budget motherboards so that I can put that money saved towards a better graphics
                        card or CPU.

                <div id="power_supply">
                    <h2>Power Supply</h2>
                    <p>The Power supply is important for making the components of your pc get enough juice. You can use
                        websites
                        like pcpartpicker to put together your pc build and get a rough idea of how much power your pc
                        will need. It is a good idea to
                        go over that amount. The graphics card that you buy should also give you a recommended power
                        level. One other recommendation is to get a power
                        supply with at least 80+ bronze rating. This rating basically lets you know how well your power
                        supply keeps to it's power standards.

                    <h2>PC Case</h2>
                    <p>When looking for a PC Case, it is important to make sure it has good airflow, as well as areas
                        that will allow you to
                        manage cables. Usually, it is good to look at newer cases that have USB 3.0 ports and a place
                        for the power supply at the bottom.
                        Aside, from that, it is important to get a PC case that looks good. It is the part of the pc
                        that you will see the most and it should be
                        a design that you will not regret.

            <div class="picking_13">
                <div id="Monitor">
                    <h2>Monitor</h2>
                    <p>The monitor really should not go at the bottom as it is also an incredibly important part of your
                        computer
                        experience. However, since it is not really part of the tower I put it here. Monitors are
                        seperated into 1080p, 1440p and 4k graphical fidelities. When building your pc, you should
                        really think about what resolution
                        you would like to game at before starting. Make sure to choose a graphics card that will be able
                        to utilize your monitor properly. My biggest recommendation when choosing a monitor is
                        to choose one that has a 144hz or above refresh rate. This allows you to game with a resolution
                        that will better match your framerate and allow for much smoother gameplay. Screen panels like
                        IPS, VA, TN are important
                        terms when looking into monitors. Usually quality goes IPS > VA > TN and so does price. However
                        TN panels have merit in competative gaming scenarios.
