        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Helvetica</h4>
        <p>I like the way that the fonts that came with the program look
            so I will keep them for now.
        </p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: sans-serif </h4>
        <p>Same reasoning for this font as well. I will certainly mess around with the font settings
            as we go on.
        </p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
            shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
            alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
